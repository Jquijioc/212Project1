# 212 Project 1
Project members: Summer Lizarda, Jonathan Ok, Joseph Quijioc, Amer al Sayari

## Summary of the Project

The premise of this project, from the assignment itself, is to "build a gradebook application to interpret course grades into categorical totals and semester final grades."

The viewable outputs of the program should include:
files: main.cpp, gradebook.cpp, gradebook.h


## Planning of the Project

Pseudocode For Main.cpp

``` 
#include "gradebook.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    
    //skeleton code for file input and storing the numbers
    //declare file name as argv1
    //use ifstream read data from the file
    //declare vector within a vector to hold courseGrades
    //declare a string
    
    //declare gradeCategory vector to hold grades for each category
    //use a while loop to read line by line and push back the grades into the gradeCategory vector
    //stringstream the line

    return 0;
}

```
example pseudocode 2

```
//put code in between the tics

```
